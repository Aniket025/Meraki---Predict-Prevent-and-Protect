Meraki uses  **AI** to predict, prevent and help people respond quickly during and after a disaster. Our model focuses on providing information to four type of users -> victims , citizens , volunteers and organizations. We aim to solve various problems that are associated with the pre-disaster, disaster and post-disaster phase.
## Models Overview
### Prediction maker  
It uses AI to make prediction of  disasters like earthquake,flood,forest fire and cyclone in advance by crunching chunks of data ( historical and real time ) and in-depth analysis of other related factors respective to each natural disaster.
### Prevention system
It automatically notifies government, citizens and other disaster management agencies which helps them take steps to prevent losses ( life and resources ) if possible. Also natural disasters like forest fire can be prevented by early notification and early steps to eliminate it.
### Management System
- It connects first responders ( government, other agencies and volunteers ) with victims and gives them relevant information so as to take proper actions.
- Most importantly we will give proper management to the volunteers so that just the right number of volunteers are present at the spot.
- From the prediction of the natural disaster we will also provide information of closest safe spots where victims will be brought and other aids like clothes, medicines will be stored there only which will eventually help in faster service and efficient management.
- We use image processing to identify victims by matching their faces with the database of photos of missing people. By this family members can be informed and asked for any documentation or financial aid required.
- Traffic routing system to give knowledge of right path to follow for safe spots or other amenities like petrol, food, etc.
## Who will use and how will it function?
### Victims:
- Chatbot ( when internet is not available, victims may use the chatbot service using sms )
- SMS and notifications for steps to take
- Traffic routing 
- Showing safe spots
- Facial recognition to give information to family 
### Citizens:
- Showing safe spots, safe routes and notifying about the disaster
- Predictions of natural disasters 
- Can help in contributing to tell safe routes
- Instructions for precautions to be taken
### First responders ( volunteers, government and other agencies ) :
- Conducting fundraisers
- Notifying location of victims ( heatmap ) for suitable steps to be taken
- Giving predictions to take proper steps 
- Providing safe route to any victim or safe spots to provide them with medical and food aid
